Estimate one rep maximum lifts in JS using the Epley or Brzycki formulas

### Other Formulas

One rep maximum estimation formulas [tend to underestimate](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/232239360_The_Accuracy_of_Prediction_Equations_for_Estimating_1-RM_Performance_in_the_Bench_Press_Squat_and_Deadlift) the true 1RM, dramatically so in the case of the deadlift. Underestimating a true maximum is almost always beneficial. I'll take PRs for other formulas but have chosen to only include the two most popular.
